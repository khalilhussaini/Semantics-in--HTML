        <Strong> Semantics in HTML</Strong>
    
    </legend>
    <p><span>&#128073;</span>in html,for example,the element is asemantic elemant,which gives the text it wraps around the role(or meaning)of "a top level heading on your page."</p>
    <details>
        <summary><mark>here is a top level of heading </mark></summary>
     </details>
     <p><span>&#128073;</span>by default,most browsers user agent stylesheet will style an with a large font size to make it look likea heading(although you could style it to look like anything you wanted).on the other hand, you could make any element look like a level heading .</p>
      <details>
     <summary><mark>consider the following </mark></summary>
     </details>
    <p><span>&#8680;</span> this will render it to look like a top level heading,but it has no semantic value,so it will not get any extra benefits as described above .it is therefore a good idea to use right HTML element for the right job .</p>
    <p><span>&#8680;</span>HTML should be coded to represent the data that will be populated and not based on it default presentation styling.presentation (how it should look ),is the sole repensibilaity of css. </p>

     <Strong> some of the benefits from writing semantics markup are as follows:</Strong>
     <fieldset>
     <legend>
     <ul>
        <li> search engines will consiter its contents as important keywords to influence the pages search rankings </li>
        <li>screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate aa page </li>
        <li>Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless divs with or without semantic or namespaced classe </li>
        <li>Suggests to the devloper the type of data that will be populated</li>
        <li>semantic naming mirrors proper custom element\component naming</li>
